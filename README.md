# Time-Series-Analysis-with-SARIMAX

Modules needed = Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Statsmodels

Time series analysis means to predict values od a given time span for eg: we are given a data set that contains sales of a company of 10 years 
and we are asked to predict the sales of the company for next 2 months in that we use a method called time series analysis which can be done easily
by the use of a module present in Python named Statsmodels.


Here, we are given a dataset that contains the data of milk production by per cow (in pounds) from January 1962 to December 1975 and we have to calculate milk production for next two years
